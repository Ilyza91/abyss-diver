@@.layerTitle;LAYER 4 - HOARFROST WASTES@@

You finally emerge from the tunnels of the third layer and are given the least warm greeting to the fourth possible: a blast of chilling air that you feel settling into your bones near-instantly. Eyes adjusting once more to the Miasmal light, your first look at the layer is of a blanket of snow extending far into the fog-covered horizon, punctuated by small glacial mountains as the ground slowly meaners downward. miasma-produced winds sometimes dislodge buildups of ice on the ceiling, causing it to drift down to the ground as snow or hail. What little begetation there is struglle to survuve in this layer grows small and sparse.

This layer is enveloped in a bitter, piercing cold, strengthened by Miasma to effectively penetrate any kind of insulating clothing or similar protection. Your only option for staying warm is an active source that radiates heat. Without somehing easily portable, like a torch, you'll need to frequently stop to take shelter to start campfires. If you have a portable heat source, you may subtract 2 days from all time costs on this page. The 5 romer stones together don't quite produce enough heat to keep you warm on their own.

The deep cold of this layer seems to penetrate any clothing and shelter you rely on. Snow drifts gently to the ground around you, and everwhere you look is coated in either a powder of snow or a layer of clear, frozen ice. Your only relef is when you take the time to stop at camp to eat, drink, and enjoy the warmth of your nightly campfire.

	You put on the self-warming winter clothes. The romer stones give off a small amount of heat at the locations where you incorperated them in the gear. At first you still feel cold and you wonder if it's going to be warm enough in the end. After a while though, the insulation does it's job trapping the heat and you feel almost comfortable in it.<br><br>

Between this layer and the next is a kilometers-long sheer drop with a near-featureless wall of slippery wall of rock and ice on all sides. Paths and tunnels onward to the next layer exist, but they're very slow and meandering, and taking these down to the next layer, combined with the time trekking through the main body of this layer, will take 19 days by default. If you have rope wih you, you can instead descend right through this dividing space in a much shorter time, and the whole trip will only take 8 days. Remember that the return trip takes longer than the trip down, either way.

The air seems to get drier as you proceed fuurther down. You might want to stockpile plenty of water before continuing on, probably around 2 weeks worth at a minimum.

A shiver runs down your spine, but it doesn't stop at the bottom. The shiver continues towards an imaginary extension of your spine that moves outward from directly above your butt. You involuntarily squirm at first, due to the unfamiliar sensation, but after a few seconds you're able to accomodate it and accept it as just another physical sensation, like your body was adapting to the new sensory inputs.

When you look behind you to see what happened, you're surprised by the sight of a large, spiked, scaled reptile tail that seems to respond to your thoughts! It's your own tail, a part of your own body! This may take some time to get used to.

<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Tranquility Knell")>>
The Drifting Swallower detects its prey by the vibrations that surround them, but the Tranquility Knell silences the noise in both the air and all other media, meaning the vibrations are nearly silenced and the Swallower is left nearly blind. This effect should give you 30 minutes where the creature is unable to find you, allowing you to escape unnoticed until you are out of range.<br>
[[Escape with the Tranquility Knell|Layer4 Exit2]]<br><br>

If you allow it to overpower you, prepare to be vored! It will swallow you whole and you will spend the next 3 days inside of it's large stomach being tickled and lightly burned by gastric juices lapping over your whole body. After you are eventually expelled from the creature, you'll be left with persistant light burns, increasing all travel costs by 1 day until you are cured. This will not heal without a medkit.<br>

:: Layer4 Preview [image layer4 noreturn]
As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Layer Intros/l4intro.png']]

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 4 - HOARFROST WASTES@@

You see yourself trudging through thick layers of snow, and even with only your sight to view the layer, a deep sense of chills runs through you, as if the cold here were able to seep into your very being. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor that you could find on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the relic is cracked and broken.
