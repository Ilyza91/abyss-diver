@@.layerTitle;LAYER 2 - DEWDROP RAIN UNDERBRUSH@@

As you enter the second layer, the clear open fields of the first gradually give way to a convoluted mass of trees, vines, and thorns, a thicket more dense than any you've ever seen. You proceed further down, the inscrutable tangle of plant matter growing taller and taller above you, eventually completely shielding the first layer from view. You feel a light pinprick on your nose and look up, thinking it to be rain, but no - these drops are falling from the plants above you, tiny dewdrops coalescing on the vines, falling down as a light drizzle at first, gathering yet more water as they fall through the enormous jungle, and finally reachiing the roots of some of the tallest trees as a veritable monsoon.

This layer is filled with a very dense growth of vines, bushes, and other plant life that impedes you and makes movement very time-consuming. Having a way to clear them out of your way would make navigation much easier. Subtract 1 day from every time on this layer (including the cost of going up or down layers) if you have a sword with you to cut through the flora.

The dew continually drips down around you, creating the illusion of a rainstorm without clouds. The atmosphere is heavy, partially with humdity, but mainly with the ever-present, creeping corruption of the miasma.

This layer is filled with a vey dense growth of vines, bushes, and other plant life that impedes you and makes movement ver time-consuming.

<<if $layerTemp == 1>>
<br><br>Above you, a blood-curdling screech fills the air. Freezing in fear, a bird seems to fly from the canopy above you, paying no mind to you on the ground. Strangely, it looks almost like a hawk, but as if its mouth were turned sideways and it's wings were a bit too sharp-edged to match any bird you've seen before. However, you don't get a chance to get a good look at it before it flaps it's wings and and leaves you once again with only the sound of the dripping rain. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
<br><br>At one point along your path, you spot a tangle of vines that seem to rustle slightly, but upon further inspection there is nothing inside them. After spending a minute watching them, you realize the sound comes from the speed at which the vines are growing, which seems to be a few centimeters a minute. You also hear a crunch, which seems to originate from the long-deadbskeleton of a small mammal being crushed by the vines. Wisely, you decide to move on and conclude this would not be a good place to make camp. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 3 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Saeko") && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Lily")>>
<br><br>You hear a loud hissing sound in one of the bushes nearby, and suddenly Saeko stops your group from moving forward. "Wait, we have to go around here. I'm not sure what would make a sound like that here, but I suspect it's not a good idea to find out. Lily almost walks forward on her own and rapidly comments, "I don't know either! I really want to find out though! It can't be that bad if it's only on the second layer, right?" Saeko grabs her collar and sighs, "I believe I heard of a certain diver who thought similarly, but he was lost a few years ago. Better not to fall prey to some unkown venomous creature here." Lily hesitates, but eventually agrees and your group ends up going around the potential threat.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 4 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Cherry")>>
<br><br>A small feline-looking creature approaches you and gives a little mewling sound. As you hesitate with how to react, Cherry bends down and rubs it behind one of its furry ears. Her expression is blank and she sighs as the feline mews, whispering under her breath, "I remember this being fun. Why isn't this fun anymore?" She stands up and steps back, giving you a chance o touch the feline, feeling that it feels much softer than you'd expect, as if it were a sack of blubber rather than a cat. But after a few minutes, it gets tired of your touches and tightens up as it scampers away. Cherry is staring at the sky, letting the rain run down her face with no resistance. <<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Maru")>>Maru walk over to her and gives her a big, warm hug, but despite reaching her arms around him, her expression never changes.<<endif>><br><br>

After spending a few days seeking out the statue you heard may grant you a boon on this layer, you find it past a glade surrounded by dark, foreboding trees.

As you place your hand on the alabaster hand of demonic statue before you, a shiver runs through your spine. You have a sense that the corruption is closing in on you, and for a moment you feel acute claustrophobia. But after another moment it passes, and as long as you keep your corruption above 0, you should be fine and come out on top of this deal.

In the morning, you wake up to a very different circumstance. Whose body do you wake up in?

Using your knowledge of the Abyss, you look around briefly before finding the Bewitcher Plants you were looking for. Carefully, you extract water from the flowers, checking it to make sure it's pure before giving it a taste.

You see yourself standing under the cover of a dense rainforrest, with great trees covering your view and continuous rain pouring down through the layers of branches and vines. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the relic is cracked and broken.
