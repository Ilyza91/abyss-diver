@@.layerTitle;LAYER 1 - ARCADIA'S GARDEN@@

Stepping across the sparse grasses, eyes occasionally catching on some flowers that are much more vulvic than any you've seen before, or perhaps a rock formation that seems far too phallic to be natural, you proceed down the relatively tranquil first layer of the Abyss. The town already begins to disappear from view above you, and below you is nothing but gentle, lush slopes leading further into the dark.

Traveling back to the surface from here will take 1 day, and will cost 10 corruption. Leaving the abyss also requires that you don't have any negative corruption points even if you plan to come back.

You find yourself amidst the slightly-off natural splendor of the first layer. What do you want to do while you are here?

<<if $layerTemp == 1>>
<br><br>Crawling up a tree you spot an odd looking caterpillar, it almost looks like a disembodied human phallus, but it seems to have sharp spines rather than hair. You probably wouldn't want to put this is any places you'd usually put a cock.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
<br><br>In the distance you can hear some people yelling about something, but you can't quite make it out. When you get a bit closer, you can't seem to find any people, but you do see some spare clothes on the ground and some rustling in the bush nearby. Rather than waiting for the people to return, you choose to move on.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 3>>
<br><br>Near the top of the layer, you notice a completely normal woman carrying a full pack trying to aproach the surface, but she seems to be having a great difficulty moving forward. "Why can't I just leave?" She calls out in exasperation to no one in particular. It seems the Abyss itself is impeding her, so you couldn't help her even if you tried.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 4 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia")>>
<br><br>Khemia turns towards you smugly, "You know $app.name, this whole layer is a breeze if you've been around a few times. I think we could probably clear out anything worth doing in less than a day if we took the right shortcuts. This is barely even a speed bump on our path to the bottom of the Abyss for the right people. And who do you think knows the shortcuts?" He smiles widely and puffs out his chest, gesturing to himself with his thumb before leading you down the most efficient path to your destination.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 5 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Saeko")>>
<br><br>You spot Saeko crouching near a tree stump with some mold grown over it, wrinting in a notebook. She looks up at you and comments, "You know, this isn't really a tree stump. It's a fungus that's shaped itself like a dead tree, an interesting case of mimicry." She digs up a bit of the dirt by the base of the apparent stump and reveals a gray texture leaking a creamy white liquid below the surface. "I wonder what this is doing? The ecology here is so strange, even though it's so close to the surface..." Her musings trail off, but she stands up and you get moving again towards your destination.<br><br>

As you and Maru search for an interesting doll you've heard about, you come across the decaying jusk of a house. It looks as if someone once lived here, but it has been long since abandoned to be degraded by the forces of the Abyss.

You enter the ruined home, and after exploring each of the rooms, you happen to come across a perfectly preserved tea table, with a strange looking doll sitting in a chair. Maru notices your discovery, but looks worried and comments, "Why isn't the table rotting? I feel like something's wrong here..." his voice trails off, letting the comment hang for a moment more than you're both comfortable with.

You try to comfort Maru, but he insists he isn't afraid of the doll. "It reminds me of something I used to play with, I think. But it can't be..." At the same time, you get sense that it is almost exactly like a doll you had as a child, except you know you definitely didn't have a doll like this one. It fits right into the uncanny zone of feeling familiar, yet intensely alien in a way that makes you feel strong discomfort just from looking at it.

"I don't thik we should take it." Maru crosses his arms, but after a few more words of encouragement from you, he accepts your decision. It can't really cause many problems, it's just a doll, right?

Recognizing the doll's mysterious properties and potential value, you overcome your aversion and take it with you. As you pick it up, you catch a glimpse of the doll smiling, but when you look at it more closely you can tell that its sewn mouth is as static as it ever was.

:: Pick up the Hive Tassel [layer1]
<<set $ownedRelics.push($relic8)>><<set $corruption -= Math.max(($relic8.corr - $corRed), 0)>>

As you wander through a grove of trees in search of the mysterious tassel that's somehow connected to the bees, you notice something new. A constant buzzing surrounds you all at once, as if you were swallowed by a swarm of bees. And in fact, when you glance at the trees, you can see that their bark is now impossible to make out, instead covered in layers of yellow and black insects moving over each other.

Then they begin to take flight, filling the air with black and yellow bugs and filling your ears with an intense droning sound.

As you<<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>> and your companions<<endif>> brace for the pain of the piercing stingers and nearly panic, you realize none of the bees are hurting you. In fact, none seem to be landing on you at all, leaving you a space of about a meter of peace within the ordered chaos of the swarm.

The strange sight in front of you also gives you the chance to notice a few odd things. Firstly, the bees seem strangely proportioned, as if their heads were too big for their bodies, making them almost look like a different type of insect altogether if it weren't for their coloration and behavior. Second, the apparent bees are not moving randomly, they seem to be pairing up and rubbing their bodies quite vigorously against each other before leaving and moving to a new partner. It occurs to you that perhaps you're in the middle of an orgy for these pseudo-bees. Third, you hear a second buzzing sound, one that sounds less like the buzzing of a bee and more like someone hitting wood together very quickly.

As you investigate the new sound, you spot a tree with a few branches vibrating and smacking against each other, with the apparent culprit being a small scrap of cloth gently wrapped around one of the branches. Spotting your goal, you're easily able to pull the vibrating tassel away from the tree, and as you leave the copulating swarm, the tassel becomes still, leaving only the strong smell of honey and its honeycomb pattern to signify there's anything unusual about it.

You feel an intense squeezing sensation between your legs, as if something was squeezing your cock extremely tightly, but not in a pleasurable way.

And it just keeps squeezing as if the pressure was resisting your current size and was pushing part of you back into your body.<br><br>

After a few moments of this sensation, it fades, leaving you to deal with the aftermath. When you check yourself, it looks like your penis has almost entirely disappeared, leaving only a small nub, more reminiscent of a clitoris than your previous size.

You feel an intense squeezing sensation on your breasts, but it isn't like someone's hand squeezing them in a pleasurable way. It feels like a pressure evenly distributed across them, like if you're deep underwater, but only on your chest. After a moment, the pressure increases, feeling like it is pushing your flesh into your abdomen, even if there's nowhere for it to go.<br><br>

Instinctively, your hands move up to your chest in response to the strange sensation, and you feel your flesh squirming and pulsing under your fingers. It feels like your body is trying to burst out of some imaginary constraint, but is failing, and each attempt is more feeble than the last. And after a few more attempts, your body succumbs and the sensation fades, leaving you with much smaller assets than you had before.

You suddenly feel a tingling sensation over your whole body below your scalp, which suddenly becomes very itchy as each of the hair follicles on your body expels any hair they held within them and then shrivels up forever. A cursory feel of your body reveals that your skin is much smoother, aside from any existing marks or scars you have. It feels as if your whole body has been waxed, but even more than that in some way, as you know none of the hair will ever return, nor could you create a facsimile of hair anywhere on your body.

You shiver at the sensation, but it quickly passes. You're left with shaking the remaining residue out of your clothes so that it doesn't cause you to get itchy later on your journey.

A brief wave of ice washes through your hair, or at least that's what it feels like as the pigments in your hair seem to have instantaneously swapped with new ones.

After the sudden wash, you instinctively reach a hand above your head to grab a lock of your hair and bring it before your eyes to see what's happened to it. The hair feels like a completely normal temperature, so that was apparently only an illusory sensation, but the change of color was real. You can see that your hair seems as if it had always been its new color. Now, what color do you see?

The flesh flows outward, extending the itching sensation, as your ears become longer and gain a pointed tip. The itching fades, but your ears still feel a little more sensitive than they did before.

It seems that you now look like either an elf out of a storybook or someone who really wants to look like a elf, for whatever reason. Hopefully you don't mind the occasion odd look if you return to the surface like this.

A brief tingle passes between your legs<<if $app.breasts > 0>> and your breasts<<endif>>, causing you to immediately come to attention at the momentary sensitivity.

You pause for a moment to catch your breath and wait for the sensation to pass, but it never does. It seems this is your new baseline of sensitivity from now on. You won't be going back to the way things were before, you'll just need to learn to deal with the new stimulation of any touch between your legs.

You dip each of your flasks into the miasma-contaminated water in some of the lower cloudpools where it has collected. As you take a test-sip of the water you feel a subtle pulsing through your body, as if your body were trying to expand as quickly as it could. Despite this side-effect, you need the water, so you continue to fill your flasks for your future travels.
<<else>>
Using your knowledge of the Abyss, you specifically look to make sure you can get some good water directly from the clouds. You spot a couple easy pools where you could easily get a drink, but avoid the tainted water in favor of the pure water from a gentle waterfall you come across along your path. A taste test confirms that the water is indeed pure and you fill all of your empty flasks in preparation of continuing your journey.

When you first saw Outcast village you already fell in love. Its rustic charm endeared you. So eventhough you weren't to severly effected by the curses from the abyss you decided you wanted to stay here anyway. Over time you quickly became closely connected with the rest of the small community. You enjoyed your life for the most part but as time grew on you started to mis some of the ammenities the top side could provide you. Although you still went to the surface on occasion to enjoy those you started to wonder if there wasn't something that could be done in Outcast village. You debated it a bit with the rest of the community and decided to put the fortune you had left over from your abyss diving days into water turbines to improve the power available for the village. Over time this modernised the town a bit as appliances from the surface started pouring in, but in the end Outcast village never really lost its rustic feel. For your efforts the community promoted you to the mayor of the town, which you gladly accepted. With a community of around 300 people it was more a title than a job anyway. And so you lived a long confortable and quite life in Outcast village.

Unfortunatly you didn't have the means to help the community out in any significant way. It didn't matter the slow life in Outcast village started to grow on you more and more. Some days after helping out in the fields you found that you could just enjoy yourself sitting near a water edge and laying back in the grass, listening to the sounds of nature around you. You became a valued and central member in the community of Outcast village, spending many evening drinking and sharing stories about your abyss diving days. In the end you lived a simple but happy life in Outcast village

At some point enough is enough, and with your body regressed at much as yours was you felt it would be better to just call it quits. With your apperent young age you felt it would be difficult to return to the surface so you settled in Outcast village. While you could see various other ex-adventures that had also regressed quite far, most seem at least to still be at a teenager level, and you felt you were being treated more like a kid than the rest. Of course you looked at ways to provide for yourself but that proved more difficult than you thought. You couldn't help out in the fields around town and working on some of the construction projects was even more impossible. If it waren't for your considerable savings after you abyss diving adventure you wouldn't have known what to do. Outcast village was very accomodating to regressed divers so you were able to buy a place for yourself and maintain yourself for a while. You decided to still be frugal thought, not knowing how long it would take before your could work for your own food. Before long some people in the cummunity understood what was going and before you knew it you felt like you were constantly surrounded by people, bringing food or treating you to a diner. Sometimes you felt you were being babysat by 300 people, but at the same time being looked after by 300 people also felt nice. The family across the streat was especially nice, at some point you spend more than half the nights eating at their place. The days you stayed at home the father of the family would still check up on you in the morning and in the evening the mother would often stop by to bring you some left over diner (which tasted suspiciously fresh). SHe never left before giving you a big kiss and a big hug. Over time you became sort of the town mascot and every where you go people greeted you and asked if they could help you with stuff. When you first started to live Outcast village you worried that grow back up by yourself woudl be really hard but after a few years it was clear that your family that helped you allong the way was now bigger than ever.

With your apperent young age you felt it would be difficult to return to the surface so you settled in Outcast village. While you could see various other ex-adventures that had also regressed quite far, most seem at least to still be at a teenager level. With not much left over from your abyss diving expedition you felt at a loss. You couldn't help out in the fields around town and working on some of the construction projects was even more impossible. Luckily the rest of the small community quickly recognised you plight. A small family basically adopted you into their household. Over time they really started to feel like a real family to. You looked up to your new stepdad, he worked so hard in the village but when he came home he always had time mess around with you, giving you horserides on his neck. He really loved his new little <<BreastCorrected>><<PerceivedGender>>. Your older stepsister wasn't always nice to you, she seemed to enjoy treating you like a little kid most out of everybody as she new it stung you a bit. When she was babysitting you she would sometimes give you her old sippycup instead of a regular glass to drink. While it annoyed you it wasn't all bad as she tend to forget she was teasing you after a while and started to genuinely play games with you. And finally there was your new stepmother, although she didn't tease you with your regressed condition she simply couldn't help herself pampering you as much as she did. This also annoyed you at first but over time you started to love every second of it. She was bathing you, doing your hair, dressing you and even feeding you during dinner. As the years would go by this would slowly grow less and less, while the love for you new family only increased. Nevertheless, after many many years thoughts about venturing into the deeper layers of the abyss were entering your mind again...

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

When you go to sleep, you dream once again.

You dream about the playroom you were in, with your dolly.

Your tattered pink dress doesn't look tattered at all anymore. It looks just like your dolly's dress. In fact, you started to look more like your dolly as well. But that's okay. It makes you look like a cute pair of twins after all.

You have tea time with your dolly, chatting away about how beautiful your dresses are, how tasty your tea is, and how nice it is to spend this time together.

You also play house with your dolly, taking turns switching who is the mommy and who is the baby. And once you get tired of playing you cuddle with your dolly until you fall a sleep again, just so you could play with her more the next day! It's so much fun!

Over time she even grows a lot so you can cuddle better! That's so nice of your dolly, she is the best! She's so considerate of you, making sure you're always content and comfortable where you are.

Sometimes you get a feeling like you lost something. Somethin precious to you that is now gone and locked away. But the feeling never lasts long as you sink back into your happy and comfortable life.

<<say $rndM>> Look! There they are! We found 'em! <</say>>

<<say $rndM>> I don't know. But a relic is relic. Worst case scenario we just sell 'em. But, who knows, they might just do something awesome! Here, take one, I'll keep the other.<</say>>
<<say $rndF>> You know what, now that I'm holding one it actually doesn't feel as creepy anymore. In a weird way, it feels comforting. I think maybe I'll just keep her.<</say>>
