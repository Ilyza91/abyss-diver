@@.layerTitle;LAYER 7 - SEALED CITY OF AGARTHA@@

There is no gradual, graceful change in terrain dividing the sixth and seventh layers. The tentacles come to a sudden stop at a long series of metallic barricades, providin passage for travelers but apparently no surface for the tentacles to grow on. Grateful to leave behind the burning tendrils, you step through and are greeted with a sea of light, an enormous, city, buildings and roads expanding into the distance, yet also stacked haphazardly on top of each other in layers of chrome and neon, paved with metal. A microcosm of the Abyss itself, perhaps?

Yet for a city so large, it remains eerily quiet, the only sound being the quiet hum of robots patrolling the streets. There's no sign of any humans, or indeed any organic life at all. The city sleeps as robots silently perform their tasks, and it would be best to tread lightly, lest you wake it up.

This layer seems to be quite a bit smaller than the last few, and its paved roads are much easier to traverse. Ascending back into hell - that is, layer 6 - will take 7 days and cost 80 corruption.

As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Layer Intros/l7intro.png']]

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 7 - SEALED CITY OF AGARTHA@@

You see yourself standing in the midst of an enormous mechanical city, surrounded by artificial lights, towering buildings, and robotic drones moving busily throughout the layer. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the relic is cracked and broken.

A quiet humming sound descends upon you as you see the Taxdrone floating towards you from over a nearby building. You reach into your pack to get your typical dubloon payment, but then you realize something is wrong, you can't find any dubloons! Perhaps you didn't keep track of them properly? But it's too late to get any now, the taxes are already due.

The Taxdrone patiently requests that you submit your taxes as it displays a slot for you to deposit the dubloons into, but soon it realizes you will not be paying and the typically soft blue lights on the drone change to glaring red and an alarm sounds.

Within a moment you are restrained by nets made of light and you feel a prick on your neck. You notice the drone has stabbed you with a syringe, but at this point it's too late to resist and your consciousness begins to fade, leaving you to succumb to your fate.

You are now forced to become a permanent resident of Layer 7.

You walk through an enormous city coated in chrome and neon. On each side of the streets you can see enormous buildings with no open doors for you to enter. There are thousands of skyscrapers, yet not one person or animal in the entire city.

An enormous mechanism consisting of innumerable sets of interlocking gears appears before you. Strange symbols you don't understand cover the surface, but it seems apparent to you that there are 2 slots where you can place your Relics to make use of the Forge's effects.

If you choose to place 2 Relics in the Clockwork Forge, along with 4 dubloons, you can swap their abilities while retaining their prior shape, for example allowing you to put the Breathless Exhale and Sunbeam Relics in, to get a fire-enshrouded fan and a wind-controlling sword out.

:: Work on Heavy Lifting [layer7]
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Foraging/heavylifting.png']]

You'll be moving large, heavy metal loads (ostensibly, construction materials) around long distances. Each load weighs arbout 60kg, and you'll be transporting them around 2km on average. You get a small wheeled cart to assist, but stacking more than two on top of each other would be very precarious (not to mention extremely heavy and difficult to push.) You get 1 dubloon for each block you move.

You have obtained $heavyLiftDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

An average human working a full day at this task can make 5 dubloons per day doing this job.<<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Weakling") || $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Minish-ish") && !$playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your weak body, you cannot move any loads without assistance. You'll need to either assign a companion to work this job alone or use a Relic to make any progress.<<endif>><<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your enormous size, you can move many loads in your hands with ease. You can move up to 40 loads per day by grasping the loads in your hands, though you will need to take slightly longer paths to get to the destination.<<endif>><<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>> Your $hiredCompanions.length can also help, effectively multiplying your daily output by <<print ($hiredCompanions.length + 1)>>.<<endif>><<if $totalRelics.some(e => e.name === "Afar Wanderer")>>

You can use the Afar Wanderer on the cart to make the load significantly easier to move. While the wands becomes heavier, it doesn't gain the weight of the loads on top of the cart, so you can effectively drag the cart around much easier. If you use the Afar Wanderer, an average person could carry 10 loads per day on their own.<<endif>><<if $totalRelics.some(e => e.name === "Return to Sender")>>

You can mark 10 of the objects with the Return to Sender Relic, allowing you to recall all of them to your position. Unfortunately, this will reach the maximum distance for Return to Sender, but it will let you very quickly complete 10 loads in a single day.<<endif>><<if $totalRelics.some(e => e.name === "Superpositional Skewer")>>

You can use the Superpositional Skewer to touch the load with one end, then walk to the desired location, then tap yourself with the other end. This will result in you being transported back to the location of the loads and the load being transported to the destination. This effectively means you don't need to carry any heavy weights and only need to walk half the distance. This dramatically improves the efficiency of this job, allowing you to move up to 20 loads per day on your own!<<endif>>

You can use the Yliaster Materia to melt or vaporize the land you are excavating to make it much easier to move. Liquid can slide away and gas can disperse, as long as you're careful not to breathe any in. This doesn't completely trivialize the work, but it does make it go by significantly faster. The whip can help so much in the land excavation that if you use it, you alone can move up to 20 2x2x2 cubic meter chunks of earth in one day of labor.<<endif>>

You get a basic paint roller to do the job with, but you'll get docked pay (possibly extending to an outright fine) if you get significant levels of paint in an area you weren't assigned to cover.

You have obtained $cityPaintDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

You can use the Zelus Band to make sure you stay focused. While this doesn't make you inherently any better at painting, you will find that being perfectly focused on a task like this can allow you to accomplish much more than you would otherwise. If you choose to wear the Zelus Band, you can earn up to 3 dubloons per day while working on this job alone.<<endif>><<if $totalRelics.some(e => e.name === "Red Thread Flourish")>>

You'll be generating some energy to power the city, to be stored in case all of the hundreds of Miasma-based generator, and the emergency secondary backup generator all go out at once... Yeah, this is pointless. You'll get 4 dubloons per kWh of energy you generate, up to 80 dubloons. For this job you'll get one human-sized hamster wheel hooked up to a dynamo and energy storage unit. At a constant, sustainted, fast running pace, it'll probably take well over a full day to generat e1 kWh, and you'll need to eat and drink food and water worth much more than the energy you produce. You don't need to use the hamster wheel if you don't want to, energy from a different source can be fed into storage too.

You have obtained $energyGenDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

An average human working a full day at this task can make 2 dubloons per day doing this job.<<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Weakling") || $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Minish-ish") && !$playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your weak body, you cannot generate any significant amount of energy by running on the hamster wheel on your own. You'll need to either assign a companion to work this job alone or use a Relic to make any progress.<<endif>><<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your enormous size, you can simply use your enormous hands to rapidly spin the hamster wheel and generate a large amount of energy.

By attaching fans to the hamster wheel and blowing it with the Breathless Exhale, you can generate much more energy with much less effort than you could by running yourself. This method could generate up to 4 kWh per day, yielding 16 dubloons per day of using the Breathless Exhale to power the wheel.<<endif>><<if $totalRelics.some(e => e.name === "Toral Wave")>>

The Toral Wave generate a significant amount of energy on its own, and you should be able to find a wire to connect it to the battery realtively easily within this city. Because the maximum output of the Toral Wave is 3000 W, you can generate 3kWh per hour you use it. So in only 1 day of "work" you can generate the full 20 kWh to get 80 dubloons, without needing to do much work yourself, though you do need to stay nearby to correct occasional disconnections and errors.<<endif>>

For some reason, you find yourself paying a but more attention to the videos and voices, and you realize that they're not actually as ridiculous as you first thought.

Sure, you're free right now, but with subservience can come great pleasure, and what greater pursuit in life is there than pleasure? Your pleasure centers could be continually stimulated by following orders and following what is demanded of you.

Fine, you're an organic being, but the miraculous technology of the city could change that, they could change you so that you fit neatly into the mechanisms of society here. No need to let your messy fleshy bits get in the way of a better life for you and everyone else.

Yeah, you do have goals of things you want to do, but why are your goals more important than the goals of an entire city? Especially when they are as grand as the City of Agartha preparing for the future awakening of its organic population!

After you are pulled into the giant security robot, you are placed in a cell and bombarded with propaganda recordings about life in the city and your place in it. It seems to be nonsense, why would you want to serve organics? You are an organic!

Of course you can't tone it all out, but it's pretty easy to keep your eyes on what matters and you patiently wait until the time is up and you are released.

Once again, you are pulled into the security robot to hear the familiar tales of how to be a productive part of society.

For some reason, you find yourself paying a but more attention to the videos and voices, and you realize that they're not actually as ridiculous as you first thought.

Sure, you're free right now, but with subservience can come great pleasure, and what greater pursuit in life is there than pleasure? Your pleasure centers could be continually stimulated by following orders and following what is demanded of you.

Fine, you're an organic being, but the miraculous technology of the city could change that, they could change you so that you fit neatly into the mechanisms of society here. No need to let your messy fleshy bits get in the way of a better life for you and everyone else.

Yeah, you do have goals of things you want to do, but why are your goals more important than the goals of an entire city? Especially when they are as grand as the City of Agartha preparing for the future awakening of its organic population!

When the robot releases you, you are tempted to go back and take up residence here, but shake off the feeling and continue your journey.

Once again, you are pulled into the security robot to hear the familiar tales of how to be a productive part of society. And yeah, you do wish you were a better member of society, don't you?

The arguments they are making actually make perfect sense, they seem to precisely match your own thoughts actually. As if they were molded to you (or the other way around.)

With subservience can come great pleasure, and what greater pursuit in life is there than pleasure? Your pleasure centers could be continually stimulated by following orders and following what is demanded of you.

The miraculous technology of the city could change that, they could change your organic body so that you fit neatly into the mechanisms of society here. No need to let your messy fleshy bits get in the way of a better life for you and everyone else.

Why are your goals more important than the goals of an entire city? Especially when they are as grand as the City of Agartha preparing for the future awakening of its organic population!

When the robot releases you, you are free to go, but you do not use that freedom.

Now is your chance, you've found a place where you belong.

It's time to stay in your new home.

You tell the robot that you are ready to take your place as a gear in the mechanism of society and almost immediately a syringe comes out of the wall and pokes your neck. You smile as your consciousness fades.

[[Awaken to your new life|Layer7 Tax End]]

<<else>>

After you are pulled into the giant security robot, you are placed in a cell and bombarded with propaganda recordings about life in the city and your place in it. It seems to be nonsense, why would you want to serve organics? You are an organic!

The biggest threat here is your boredom, honestly. While you try to fall asleep the robot makes an effort to keep you awake, in a kind of minor psychological torture through annoyance.

Eventually you are released though, with no harm done, and ready to continue your journey in the seventh layer.
