Other subjects of the picture, inclyding humans will appear too, reacting to situations and conversations just as the 'real' subject would. The user will exit the simulatef world if they travel 100m (330ft) from where the photographer was, if 1 hour passes, or if they die, returning to the real world with no appatent time haing passed.

Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would redduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways.
