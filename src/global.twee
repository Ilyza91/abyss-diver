:: Habitation Ending [ending]
You've reached the end of your journey due to a successful habitation ending. Was it worth it? Did you find what you were looking for?

You can find your collection of relics in your inventory, and your curses in the stats page.

Feel free to begin a new journey, by restarting and choosing the new game+ option. Also feel free to post your build on the thread for the game, the creator of this adaptation always loves to see how people's adventures went!


:: Adjustments [noreturn]
Use this page ONLY to adjust numbers due to interactions that save you money or resources that are not already accounted for in the game, or if there was a bug.

Do not cheat or fear the consequences of angering the things that lurk deep in the Abyss.


[[Adjust dubloons]]
[[Adjust corruption]]
[[Adjust time]]
[[Adjust water]]
[[Adjust food]]
[[Adjust bullets]]

Many options have their abilities as something like a light source or heat source automatically accounted for, but if you find a relic or combination that you think should give you an ability and it doesn't, use one of the following options to give that ability to yourself.

Click this if you have found something that can be used for cutting like a sword:
[[I have a Cutting Instrument|Adjustments][$cut = 1]]
[[No Cutting Instrument|Adjustments][$cut = 1]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used as a light source:
[[I have a Light|Adjustments][$light = 1]]
[[No Light|Adjustments][$light = 0]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used as a substantial heat source:
[[I have a source of Heat|Adjustments][$heat = 1]]
[[No Heat|Adjustments][$heat = 0]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used as a climbing rope:
[[I have something that can be a Rope|Adjustments][$rope = 1]]
[[No Rope|Adjustments][$rope = 0]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used for swimming underwater, similar to scuba gear:
[[I have something that can be used for Swimming|Adjustments][$scuba = 1]]
[[No Swimming|Adjustments][$scuba = 0]]

<<if $abyssKnow == 1>>Click this if you'd like to disable the use of your abyssal knowledge from the encyclopedia or Saeko (This will result in more side effects from foraging):

:: Version End
That's all for this version!

Thank you for playing version 0.4 of the interactive adaptation of Abyss Diver by FloricSpacer.

I'd like to hear any feedback about the current state of the game and any bugs or typos you've found!

I'm working on adding the remaining layers quickly, though it is pretty labor intensive, so that depends on my free time irl. I think a lot of the systems from the first few layers should carry over to later ones well, but there are also a lot of new mechanics that need to be implemented. Hopefully it doesn't take long and I can post the rest of the layers soon!

As I add more systems and the game gets more complicated under the hood, I expect many bugs that I didn't catch to manifest, so detailed bu reports for any errors you've encountered are very valuable.

Thanks again for playing!

<<if $items[1].count < -5>>
Your food ration count has gone below -5, indicating that you have avoided eating for a few days, but eventually starved to death. If you didn't realize what had happened, you can avoid this fate by pressing the back arrow in the top left until you reach the main part of a layer. Once you are there, you can take the habitation option for your layer to avoid death.

Your days of water remaining count has gone below -2, indicating that you managed to survive without water for a few days, but eventually died of dehydration. If you didn't realize what had happened, you can avoid this fate by pressing the back arrow in the top left until you reach the main part of a layer. Once you are there, you can take the habitation option for your layer to avoid death.
<<endif>><<if $corruption < 0>>

Due to your negative corruption, you are unable to accept a habitation option at this time. However, you can go back to the main part of the layer, then take curses until you have reached a corruption above 0 to survive. This is highly reccomended if you wish to avoid death.

:: BrokerEnd
YOU MAY NOT ALLOW YOUR CORRUPTION TO GO BELOW 0 DUE TO YOUR BROKER'S DEAL.

You have chosen to accept the deal of the Empty-handed Broker and attempted to take an action that would reduce your corruption points below 0. Because this is not possible, you must go back to avoid performing this action.

If you would still like to perform this action, you may go back to the main part of the layer you were on and accept curses to raise your corruption point total.

<<say $mc>> You know, we're traveling together in one of the most dangerous places in the world, yet I know almost nothing about you. Do you want to tell me anything about yourself?<</say>><br>

<<endif>>

<<if $choice1==1>>
<<say $mc>>Could you tell me something about your childhood?<</say>><br>

<<say companion1>> Well, I was mostly raised by my big sister. She was nice, but not exactly the most gentle person ever. Maybe overprotective would be a better way to describe it. When I was younger I wasn't really allowed to play outside or do anything that might be too rough. Sometimes it was a lttle annoying, but I understand why she was doing it.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>I can imagine that was a little tough.<</say>><br>

<<say companion1>>Yeah, but it wasn't all bad. I think she was just looking out for me, since I am the youngest. We were a very tight family, so we did a lot of stuff with each other. And in a way it forced me to learn to cook and sow as well, since I wanted to do things with my sister.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>> Is that also the reason why you are wearing feminine clothing? Were they forcing you to do this?<</say>><br>

<<say companion1>> No! No, nothing like that. As a child I think I looked pretty feminine.  Well, even more than now I mean. My sisters liked to play dress-up with me, and I actually liked it too. Sometimes I thought that I shouldn't be doing it, but eventually I realized that if it makes me happy, then there's no reason I should stop.<</say>><br>

He pauses for a moment as he seems to gather his thoughts.<br><br>

<<say companion1>> Over time I really began to appreciate how well my sisters cared for me. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I was glad they accepted what I liked and we could do things together and be happy.<</say>><br>

You ponder his story for a bit.<br><br>
<<say $mc>> Thanks for sharing that with me. How are your sisters doing?<</say>><br>

His expression falls, and he looks down in silence for a few seconds before responding. <br><br>
<<say companion1>>They all left.<</say>><br>

After a few more moments he forces a smile and continues. <br><br>
<<say companion1>> Anyway, don't let your meal get cold!<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Oh, sure, thanks for the meal!<</say>><br>
As you take in the food, you realize it takes shockingly good for something made with such limited ingredients. How did he manage to get the texture just right and the flavors perfectly balanced all the way down here? Maru giggles as he looks at you eating his food.<br><br>
<<say companion1>> Well, if you like it this much, I'll be sure to make it like this more often!<</say>><br>
Every 10 days, Maru will make a meal with 1 day worth of food that will keep you satisified for 2 days, saving you 1 day of food rations!<br>

<<elseif $choice1==2>>
<<say $mc>>Why do you wear such feminine clothes if you're a guy? It's really weird.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>I don't really get it. I thought it would be more of a story, but I guess everybody has their strange quirks.<</say>><br>
Maru looks a bit downward. He opens his mouth as if to say something before closing it again. After a moment he replies.<br>
<<say companion1>> Yeah, I guess so...<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Anyway, as long as you keep cooking these delicious meals, you won't hear me complaining about whatever you want to wear while you cook them!<</say>><br>
<<say companion1>> Well, uh, thanks, I guess.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Huh?<</say>><br>

<<elseif $choice1==3>>
<<say $mc>> What's in this meal? it's really tasty!<</say>><br>
Maru looks a bit suprised and pauses for a few seconds before answering.<br><br>
<<say $companion1>> Uh, thanks, I guess?<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Did I say something wrong?<</say>><br>
<<say $companion1>> No, no, not at all. I was just a bit suprised that that was your question, since I thought you wanted to ask something about me, but I'm really happy that you like it!<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Like it? It's absolutely delicious!<</say>><br>
Maru smiles widely at your comment.<br><br>
<<say $companion1>> Well, in that case it would be cruel for me to not tell you the recipe! Even if it is made from the limited ingredients we have with us here!<</say>><br>
Maru tells you in detail how he prepared the dish. It's actually pretty simple, but he added some herbs with subtle flavors which seem to have a made a big difference in the final product. And his cooking method was precise to ensure the texture ended up perfect!<br>

Every 10 days, Maru will make a meal with 1 day worth of food that will keep you satisified for 2 days, saving you 1 day of food rations!<br>

She releases her grip on you and smiles widely. <br><br>
<<say $companion2>>I didn't expect such a warm welcome, but hey I'm not complaining! Especially from such a cute <<PerceivedGender>>.<</say>><br>

She winks at you and grins as she finishes her comment. You weren't sure if you were going for the cute vibe, but at the very least you want to be taken seriously as an adventurer. But on the other hand, it's good that your new teammate likes you, you suppose.<br><br>

Lily steps forward to approach you, and it almost seems like she's leaning in for a kiss. But before you can react, you suddenly feel a hard pat on your back and open your eyes to see Lily with the widest grin possible.<br><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Haha! Don't worry about it <<mrms>> hero. I can take pretty good care of myself. But I'll be sure to let you know just in case I find some other damsel in distress you can save.<</say>><br>

She starts snicker at her own joke. You're not quite sure if it's a joke at your expense though. Regardless, she seems to be in good spirits and that's what's important in the end, right?<br><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Well thank you for asking <<mrms>> boss <<PerceivedGender>>. My hobbies include listening to pop music and traveling. I've traveled to lots of countries around the world already! What can I say? I'm just the adventurous type, I guess. <</say>><br>

	<<say $mc>> Ah yes, excellent to hear that miss Lily, what would you say your...<</say>><br>

Before you can finish your sentence, she interrupts you.<br><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Oh, and anime too! The best thing is if I can combine both! I once travelled half way around the world for this awesome anime convention. You wouldn't believe the cute little snacks they had over there... <</say>><br>

	In the end Lily rambles on for quite a while about her various travels, what anime see likes, what songs she like, and what anime songs she likes. Even if you can't quite follow all of her stories, she seems happy as long as you make an effort and nod along.<br>

<<say $mc>>I'm glad to have you on board! I'm $mc.name<</say>><br>

When you look at her there is no sign of emotion, he expression seems totally blank. <br><br>

	<<say $companion4>>Look, I'm sorry if I came across as rude. It's just that... I'm not really that excited to go down, but I'll do what I must.<</say>><br>

	For a second you seem to spot a small smile creep up on Cherry, but in an instant it vanishes.<br><br>

	<<say $companion5>>Or maybe you can try one of those surprise hugs on the shopkeeper, and we can see if you'll get enough of a discount to afford everything we need. Ha ha ha!<</say>><br>

	You can't help but crack up a little at the absurdity of the proposal.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>>Ha ha, sure, but you had better not complain about not being special if I can get a discount on my own like that!<</say>><br>

:: Cloud Convo1 [noreturn]
<<nobr>>
As you were walking, Cloud suddenly sprints ahead a few meters and kneels by the side of the road. When you walk over, you see him hunched over a body with multiple injuries which seem to be bullet wounds, or maybe stab wounds?<br><br>
<<say $mc>> Oh no, what do you think happened to him? Do you think it could have been the bandits we were warned about earlier?<</say>><br>
<<say $companion5>> Hard to say for sure, but it it were bandits, they were either cruel or simple amateurs.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>> What makes you say that? <</say>><br>
Cloud points to a spot on the back of the corpse.<br><br>
<<say $companion5>> Look, here, he was shot in the back. <</say>>
You see cloud moving the body onto its belly to point at a gunshot wound in the upper back. <br><br>
<<say $companion5>> But it seems off target, if you look at the angle of entry and the trauma around the shoulders, the bullet is probably lodged in there somewhere near the shoulder blades.<</say>><br>
He then pushes the body onto its back and points at the other wounds.<br><br>
<<say $companion5>> And these are stab wounds, but every single one missed a vital organ. Based on the amount of blood here, my guess is that he bled out in the end after managing to get away at first.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>> That sounds pretty gruesome. <</say>><br>
<<say $companion5>> Indeed, check his bag. If my guess is right we might be able to find something useful. <</say>><br>

<<say $companion5>> So not cruel, just amateurs then, good to know. Okay, put it away and let's move on. <</say>><br>

You have to be willing to get your hands dirty and do what it takes to get an advantage here. We didn't hurt him and its not like he'll be using the coins any more, right? We might as well make use of anything we can to make sure we survive. That's why I've been able to make so many expeditions.<</say>><br>

	<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm excited to discover all the magical wonders the Abyss has in store for us!<</say>><br>

	She cocks an eyebrow as a response.<br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>Magical wonders? You don't seem to understand the gravity of what we will be encountering in the Abyss. It is not that there are simply a series of 'magical' wondrous things that we can enjoy, it is an apparent gap in our understanding of the rules of the universe. Even the simplest of the Relics or Wonders we will observe in the Abyss simply break the rules that humans have held dear for hundreds of years. We need to rethink everything that we know about the universe. But they do follow their own rules, so they can be scientifically studied.<</say>><br>

	Saeko seems to be getting more invested now, she begins speaking more enthusiastically about Abyssal research.<br><br>

	<<say $companion6>>And while I don't expect to immediately understand why the Abyss does what it does, I think we can at least understand how it works on a surface level. How does Miasma alter developmental processes? How long have the species in the Abyss been evolving? Can we make use of the mutational effects of the miasma intentionally in a controlled manner, perhaps cure medical conditions? The potential is nearly limitless and we need to see what we can learn from it.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues to talk about recent advances in research regarding the Abyss and the immense potential that the Abyss has, if we could only understand it well enough to use it. You don't get much of a chance to speak, but it is very informative.<br>

	<<elseif $choice2==2>>
	<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm thrilled to delve into all the mysteries the Abyss holds!<</say>><br>

	You see a twinkle in her eyes and the edges of her lips curl upwards. <br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>Me too! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>><br>
	She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.<br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>><br>

	Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.<br><br>

	<<say $companion6>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>><br>

	<<say $companion6>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>> Very good, what is your ambition for this field expedition?<</say>><br>

		<<say $companion6>>I'm very glad you asked! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss, and I'm looking to obtain data to test my hypotheses. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>><br>
	She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.<br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>><br>

	Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.<br><br>

	<<say $companion6>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>><br>

	<<say $companion6>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.<br><br>

While she doesn't seem great at picking up on sarcasm sometimes, you found your conversation very friendly and she seems to have appreciated your interest.<br><br>

		<<say $mc>>Uh, of course! So um, what do you think you can contribute to the expedition? <</say>><br>

		<<say $companion6>>Well, I can identify safe sources of water and food in the Abyss, at least in the upper layers where it has been studied and where safe sources are even available. Deeper than layer 5 no one knows much of anything, and in some layers even with knowledge there's no perfectly safe food or water. And, uh, I have stuff for some nice tea if you want some I suppose.<</say>><br>

		<<say $mc>>Oh good so we can have some tea without being corrupted in the Abyss. It's good to have comforts like that on a journey like this.<</say>><br>

		<<say $companion6>>Oof. Are you sure this is only half of the equipment? It seems pretty heavy.<</say>><br>

		You nod, but after a minute you hear her once again.

		<<say $companion6>> Did you take the weight of this bag into account when dividing the equipment? I think my portion may be too large. It might be more optimal if we moved some of the equipment around...<</say>><br>
		Perhaps you should have just carried it yourself, you thinkn as you end up spending a while sorting through the gear to lighten Saeko's load.<br>

<<say $creepydoll>> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<</say>>
A sudden sensation of intense pain surges through your body, making you double over. It feels as if your body has been engulfed by flames that sear each and every nerve in your skin, while a thousand needles are pushed deeper into you, all at once. Almost immediately, it becomes too much for you and you pass out.
[[Darkness...|Doll event][$convoStart=0]]

<<else>>
You wake up in a corner of the Relic Workshop with the doll clutched tightly in your arms, pressed against your chest. It gives a pleasantly warm feeling, comforting you after your terrifying experience before you passed out. Somehow, as you hug the doll, you feel calm and satisfied for at least a moment. When you look down and check your skin, everything seems alright, no scars or burns anywhere. Luckily it seems that your body has not actually been torn apart, instead it was either a psychic attack of some sort or a vision of a possible future. Whatever the case, perhaps its better to not proceed with the plan to cut open the doll.

Its been a long journey but everything needs to end. After long contemplation, you decide that it is time to settle down and enjoy your life. With all the money you made you even had the chance to improve the lives of a lot of people. So you chose to stay on the second layer, where you could really make a difference. The first thing you needed to do was gain their trust, so you imported food from the first layer and surface. that act brings you into the good books of almost everyone and allows you to takel the next biggest problem. The criminal activity in the second layer was even worse than expected, but you had an idea how to solve it. You talked to the mayor of the Village and after a little "donation" he allows you to start a police force. With the money you had left you founded expeditions to get more relics which you sold to pay the police force and keep importing food. This continued some time and you became quickly the most popular person on the second layer and even got elected as the mayor. Under your rule Downcast village grow almost to twice its original size. one of your most ingenious ideas was to turn it into a beloved tourist spot. Sometimes you start to miss your old life, the excitement the adventure, and even the struggle to survive. But then you look down on the city you helpt to create and remember why you gave it all up, You wanted to do good in the Abyss, and by god you did it.

You are done with this.
You started so full of hope, dreams and energy, you thought with enough determination and time you would make it to the deepest part of the Abyss ... and now look at you, your spirit is broken, your money gone and your dreams dashed. And so you find yourself back in the second layer, the heavy rain hammering on you as to remind you of your failure. The only good thing that happened to you on this good forsaken journey is that you became strong or maybe you should call it cunning or perhapse experienced, it doesn't matter anyways. What counts is getting results and your Abyss experienced learned you how to get results, that's stremgth in itself. And you are going to use this strength to your advantage like you should have done from the start. The most important lessons that you learned are 1. Kill or be killed 2. take what you need and then a little more and 3. No regrets no mercy. The Abyss is cold and uncaring and you adapted quickly to it. So you start the rest of your life. Soon everyone knows and fears you. You are feard as one of the best mercenary or assasins, not only on the second layer but also on the first and even the surface.  Your off days are spent drinking to forget, but it never wörks for long since the nightmares are just a drink too much and a drink too few away, always lurking in the back of your head.

After a long time wandering in the Abyss you are tired.
You have seen wonders and horrors alike and survived till now.
But you had to pay a heavy price. most of your autonomy is gone. You look down on yourself and see once again your childish body as the heavy rain of the second layer purs down on you.
But not everything is hopeless. On your grueling travels through the abys you made quite the fortune, making you one of the richest persons around.
But you still have the body and with that, the strength of a child, that and sporadic acts of childishness are problems you cannot overcome alone.
So you seek out the help of somebody strong who can protect you, and you find Dimitry who is willing to help you out in exchange for your coin. Dimitry lives in a slightly bigger house than common and is one of the nicest and strongest people in the second layer. It was a gamble to go to him for help but of all the people he was well known for having a soft spot for children as well as being honorable.
Soon you and Dimitry are growing closer and what began as a business deal has started to feel like a real family.
He protects you from the more unsavory people of the second layer and even trains you to hunt and fight better than before your glory days. He supports you when you wake up in the night plagued by nightmares from your old diving days. He listens to your tales about the wonders that you have seen and laughs and jokes with you. Once you are old enough again you start to hunt to support Demitry since the money you had was long spent and once your fully grown you plan to start delving again this time to support your new family.

You don’t know when it happened bur you remember you where in Downcast village when it happened. You just broke down. The Abyss had stripped you of most of you maturity and at the benefit of what? You don’t know if this childlike body was finally influencing your mental state or if it was the burden of constant struggle in general, but you broke down and you broke down hard. You cried so hard that even with constant rain of the second layer it was still clear that tears were flowing freely from your eyes. At some point a man stopped in front of you and asked what the matter was, half brawling and half stuttering you explained the whole story. He listens attentively, while you pour your heart out. At some point you calmed down and he speaks up for the first time in a while. ‘So you don’t have a lot of coin on you? Hmm there might be not much I can do than…’ He falls quiet for a while. ‘Look kid, there is something like a kids day care just ahead. In this town we have a lot of, let’s call them ‘unplanned kids’ being born. Maybe they can help you out as well, that’s all I offer’. You head towards the prescribed location and find an elderly lady with two younger aids looking over a bunch of kids, some even younger than you are. When you offer your last earnings for some food and shelter they look at each other but accept your offer anyway. They next few days you are looked after by them, although you get the feeling you are still being kept away from most of the kids, maybe its because they suspect you aren’t a normal kid or maybe it’s because they don’t want trouble with the parents of the kids who get pick-up at the end of the day. But all in all you are happy that you at least have some place to stay. You even see the man that gave you the lifesaving tip a couple of times walking by, as you wave happily to him. After a while though the old lady approaches you with the bad news that they have to put you out on the street again as they can’t support you without financial backing. You find yourself one the street once more, but within an hour the same man from before is in front of you again. ‘What happened?’ He grunts. ’They kicked me out because I had no money anymore’ you snicker. ‘How can they…?! Urgh I’ll have a word with them..’ and he walks off. He is back within a mere moments and he just waves you over. You don’t know how he did but you were allowed back. Things changed a little after that. The man, which you learned is called Dimitry started to actually visit you and would ask how they were treating you. While you didn’t care at first that you weren’t allowed to play with the other kids, you still felt somewhat adult after all, you started feeling left out and complained about it to Dimitry. That was the last time you played by yourself. As years went by Dimitry suddenly said you were going home with him that night. ‘Look kid, I just like it better when I can keep an eye on you. Besides I can teach you some fighting and hunting’. You still kept going to the day care during most days as Dimitry had to, in his word, ‘make sure you and I keep a roof over our heads’ but you spend more and more time with him. As you aged again and you become more proficient in the skills Dimitry learned you, you were more determined to ever to use them to pay him back. Pay him back for what you know he did for you, but also for what you suspected you didn’t know he did for you.

It's dark and cold in the cave you use as a refuge.
You had an interesting time in the Abyss. You saw amazing wonders and horrifying nightmares. But you paid a steep price for your adventure, you are unrecognizable as the one who started this journey, and your monstrous appearance scares even the strongest mercenary on the second layer. So you run to this cave just outside Downcast village where you now live.
Suddenly you hear a soft voice " Are you the beast that understands the human language? or better known as the transformed adventurer?."
"how do you know me?" you ask. "My employe knows a lot." the voice answers still not showing itself. "If you have enough of this cave come to this address." And then the voice is gone, outside you find a piece of paper. Sometime later you sit before a smiling man. He is not quite fat but still a bit plump and has a long mustache. "Nice to meet you my name is mister Gerard Reed and I want to hire you as my personal bodyguard"."... Why?" is all you can muster after your initial reception surprise. "Because you look like a monster... and have to be quite strong if the Abyss blessing has progressed this far, so what do you say? You don't have to do a lot just look menacing and help with the ... business a bit. In exchange, you will have a roof over your head and food on the table ... I think thats better than a cave don't you agree?". Well, what options do you have really, So you work for Mister G. Reed and become one of his most valued ... employes sowing fear and panic in the hearts of any who would oppose him.

They say money and power corrupt people, but they never delved into the Abyss.
No. the Abyss corrupts people and the money and power help you to cope with that, so it's only natural that you need more money.
After going around Downcast village looking to simply buy people to sate your sexual urges you suddenly find yourself in the office of mister Gerard Reed. 'So word on the street is that you trying to buy people. Now tell me are you a rich addict or an over enthousiastic investor'. He leans back in his big leather office chair. "A bit of both I guess' You stammer, already feeling the heat rising in your body again. 'And I was hoping you could help, you see I have specific idea..' You continue with some more determination. 'Why do you think I would be interesed in this idea of yours? I mainly wanted to meet you because you were kicking up dust. I don't like people kicking up dust in my little village' He says with a bit of an agetated tone. 'I suggest you you use all that money you apperently have to enjoy your retirement diver'. You scrape your throat, feeling a bit desperate. ".Well, I do have enough to get me started but my funds will run out rather quickly and the idea I had in mind is euh.. how should I call it. It needs someone who can deal with delicate maters."
"Eleborate" Mr. Reed says with a light sparkle in his eyes and you know you have his full attention.
"Have you ever hört of the nymphs of the third layer?"."They are a myth" he says dismissively. "Not at all I've seen them myself, all I need from you is help me fund an expedition down to the third layer, then we capture them sell some of them to rich assholes up on the surface, and with the rest, we can open a high-class brothel never seen on either layer or the surface. which will make us richer and bring tourism down to this layer".  "What about collateral should your expedition fail?" He says with a dark expression. "You can have all my cash" You say seriously. You actually don't care about the money anyway, or the potential revenue your buisness idea can generate. Ever since you got those curses you have had an almost uncontrollable sex craving and it seems to just get worse. Strangely enough the wealth of money you accuired has only made you pickier. A cheap whore just doesn't do it for you anymore, you need something exclusive and exotic. That's why this expedition must succeed.
After three grueling days where you have to take what you can to quench your ... thirst the expedition finally returns. You hired the best of the best, they were expensive but it was worth it and they return with six new Nymph slaves. Finally, you have something worthy on hand to quench your lust. Their beauty is beyond comparison and to you they look like living liquid gems.
After selling one to some dude on the surface you open the brothel with Mister Reed.
"Well, what did I tell you ?" you ask with a grin after your first session.
"They sure are easy on the eyes and they have a lot of buisness potential." He says with a wicked grin on his face. You can hardly hide your own excitement. "have you already sampled one?". Reed looks over to you with predotory smile and greedy glimmer in his eyes. "No, I haven't and I'll think I'll leave it to paying customers to sample them. More importantly when are planning to start the next expedition?". "Well since they are going to make us a lot of money, "You say while janking on one of the leashes around the necks of the slaves, " I think we can start our next one in 2 months. Maybe we can send them down to the fourth this time, the Abyss is like a garden. We just have to pluck the ripest fruits and sell them so we can continue to harvest, hahahaha "
After that exchange, you return to your new slave/toy for another round of *well-deserved* stress release. Soon your brothel becomes the biggest and best visited one in all of the Abyss. You have something for every taste: Nymphs, Nomades, but also normal humans. Your hunters also managed to get Lizard girls, dog and catgirls, most of which used to be divers, and one even got two succubi after a hard and dangerous visit to the 5th layer. Now you are one of the richest persons, maybe second only to Mr Reed, in the Abyss. you have your own harem of beautiful 'toys' who do anything your sick and deranged heart demands. Talk of you and your brothel even reaches the surface, and while you might be reviled there from time to time people come down and admit they are actually pretty jealous of you. Yes, you can really be proud of yourself you think while sampling the newest product for your customers. You are such a hard worker.

<<if $convoStart==1>>
Suddenly, you start hearing the voice of the doll again, it almost sounds like it's coming from inside your own head.

<<say $creepydoll>> Don't you sometimes get tired of all this adventuring?<</say>>

Despite your surprise, you decide to answer the doll's question.

<<say $mc>> Sometimes, I guess. It's not always easy, but the thrill of adventure more than makes up for it to me. <</say>>

<<say $creepydoll>> You know, I can feel what you feel? And what I felt was sleepyness and tired thoughts and lots of doubt. Don't lie to me. Lying is not nice. Good girls don't lie. Only BAD people lie. IF YOU LIE YOU NEED TO GET PUNISHED. I HATE LIARS! HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE THEM<</say>>

A strong, cold chill runs down your spine.

<<say $mc>>I... I'm not lying I swear! It's just that with the changes to my body I fatigue much quicker than before. I have to try harder and harder to do the same things. But I swear that I still want to discover more of the Abyss. I can't just give up and I won't! I think it's worth it and I enjoy it!<</say>>

The cold sensation dissipates and you feel a warm, soft aura comming from the doll once again.

<<say $creepydoll>> Oh, I see! You just want to have fun! I also want to have fun! You know what doesn't make you sleepy and is super fun?<</say>>

<<say $mc>> Uh, no? <</say>>

<<say $creepydoll>> Playing games, silly. We should go to my house and play all day! That would be super fun! <</say>>

You're a bit hesitant about going to god-forsaken corner of the Abyss to "play", so you try to weasle out of it while attempting to avoid the doll's anger.

<<say $mc>>Maybe that could be fun someday, okay?<</say>>

<<say $creepydoll>> Yay, I'm so happy! Because today is some day you know?<</say>>

<<say $mc>> Um, sorry, I didn't mean today. I meant another day...<</say>>

You feel very tired all of a sudden and your consciousness starts to slip away.

You start to dream.

You see yourself walking around with your dolly and at some point you recognize the outskirts of Outcast Village as you seem to pass it by. The next moment, you are in a playroom, in a house wearing a similar dress as your dolly. You look so cute together! You have tea time with her and you run around playing tag.

It's so much fun you can hardly keep track of what's happening.<<nobr>>
<<dollTF>>
<</nobr>>
As you run, you trip over something that somehow didn't seem to fully be there. The shock suddenly wakes you up, and you realize you fell over a rotting, collapsed wooden support beam. After looking around, you find yourself not in the playroom of a nice house, but in the decrepit room on the first layer where you found the creepy doll.

<<say $creepydoll>> Aww, did you have an ouchie?<</say>>

<<say $mc>> What...? Where am I? Why are we here? Why am I wearring this tattered dress?<</say>>

<<say $creepydoll>> Because it makes us look like cute twins!<</say>>

<<say $mc>> I... I don't want this. Or at least, I think I don't?<</say>>

<<say $creepydoll>> Oh somebody is grumpy, so why don't you take a nap, and then we'll decide later?<</say>>

<<say $mc>> I'd rather really not. To be honest, I just want to get my regular clothes back, to leave this place, and to go somewhere else. <</say>><br>
<<say $creepydoll>> Hmm, thats okay. We already played a lot today. We'll just play some other time. Soon...<</say>>

You scramble to get your clothes and hurry out of the rotten house, leaving this place and the doll far behind. Once there is some distance between you and the doll, you stop to change your clothes. But instead of grabbing your clothes, you find the doll in your hands, once again.

<<say $mc>> What?! How?! I'm pretty sure I grabbed my clothes, right?<</say>><br>
<<say $creepydoll>> Those smelly old things? Why would you need those? You look much better than this, you silly. Now we are cute twinsies. ISN'T THAT FUN?<</say>>

You want to throw the doll away, but your body simply refuses. At the moment it seems there is nothing you can do. No matter what you want to do, you can neither get rid of the doll, nor change your clothes.

:: DollEnd
When you go to sleep, you dream once again.

You dream about the playroom you were in, with your dolly.

Your tattered pink dress doesn't look tattered at all anymore. It looks just like your dolly's dress. In fact, you started to look more like your dolly as well. But that's okay. It makes you look like a cute pair of twins after all.

You have tea time with your dolly, chatting away about how beautiful your dresses are, how tasty your tea is, and how nice it is to spend this time together.

You also play house with your dolly, taking turns switching who is the mommy and who is the baby. And once you get tired of playing you cuddle with your dolly until you fall a sleep again, just so you could play with her more the next day! It's so much fun!

Over time she even grows a lot so you can cuddle better! That's so nice of your dolly, she is the best! She's so considerate of you, making sure you're always content and comfortable where you are.

Sometimes you get a feeling like you lost something. Somethin precious to you that is now gone and locked away. But the feeling never lasts long as you sink back into your happy and comfortable life.

<<say $rndM>> Look! There they are! We found 'em! <</say>>
<<say $rndF>> I don't know... They look pretty creepy to me.<</say>>
<<say $rndM>> Duh, that's why they are called the Creepy Twin Dolls. What else did you expect? <</say>>
<<say $rndF>> What do you think they do? I heard they're creepy, but there must be something more. Nothing is simple down here. <</say>>
<<say $rndM>> I don't know. But a relic is relic. Worst case scenario we just sell 'em. But, who knows, they might just do something awesome! Here, take one, I'll keep the other.<</say>>
<<say $rndF>> You know what, now that I'm holding one it actually doesn't feel as creepy anymore. In a weird way, it feels comforting. I think maybe I'll just keep her.<</say>>
<<say $rndM>> Haha, that was a quick 180! But I sort of get what you mean. They can be our good luck charms, maybe they'll help keep us alive.<</say>>

:: Lily ConvoPr [noreturn]
<<nobr>>
<<say $mc>>Uh, what are you doing? <</say>><br>

The moment you speak Lily makes a high pitched squeak, then she jumps up, startled, and drops the World Stone she was holding. <br><br>

<<say $companion2>>Don't sneak up on me like that!<</say>><br>

<<if $app.fit<4>>
You chuckle a little at the fact that you made a woman who could easily outmatch you physically squeak like a little girl.<br><br>
<<elseif $app.fit<=7>>
You chuckle a little at the fact that you made a woman who is possibly stronger than you squeak like a little girl<br><br>
<<else>>
You chuckle a little at the fact that you made a woman who could give you a fair physical competition squeak like a little girl.<br><br>

<<say $companion2>>Look, it's just that I like to stay in shape so I can keep going on these long adventures. Even when I'm at home I actually work out a lot, you know? And this Relc is great for keeping in tip-top shape!<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>Oh, sounds like you really keep yourself in shape then!<</say>><br>

<<say $companion2>>Yeah, I put on some loud music and just work up a good sweat. How else do you think I keep this angelic body?<</say>><br>

She puffs out her chest a bit and gestures widely over her whole body.<br><br>

<<say $companion2>>Anyway, not to say that this whole journey is not a good workout on its own, buuut... When I saw the World Stone, I started wondering if it could be even better. This could be a golden opportunity to get in better shape than ever before!<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>Oh, I see! So you want to use it to train?<</say>><br>

<<say $companion2>>Exactly, <<mrms>> smartypants. Soooo... Can I borrow it for a while? I don't want you to get rid of the best workout tool I've ever found!<</say>><br>

<<elseif $choice1==1>>

<<say $mc>>I don't know Lily, I was actually planning on selling it.<</say>><br>

Lily's expression falls and she looks down in disappointment.<br><br>

<<say $companion2>>Ah yeah, well that's okay. I mean it is your relic after all.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>Yeah, sorry about that. But you can use it until I do need to sell it, I guess.<</say>><br>

[[End the conversation|Party overview][$choice1=0, $convoStart=1]]

<<elseif $choice1==2>>

<<say $mc>>Of course Lily, as long as you're careful with it. I'll let you use it and won't sell it.<</say>><br>

<<say $companion2>>Great! You're the best, you know that? I'll be super careful with it, I promise!<</say>><br>

She immediately picks up the World Stone to try it out once again. You see her strain after a couple reps and shudder to think what the weight of the World Stone must be now.<br><br>

:: Kin Shifter Use [noreturn]
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/kinshifter.png"]]

A glob of thick, putty-like slime. the face appears decorative. When touched to another relic that you own, a portion of the slime will break off and reshape itself into a perfect replica of that Relic, gaining all of its characteristics, abilities, value, and weight permanently. It cannot shift back to its original form. The amount that breaks off is dependent on the perceived value of the Relic, which can be measured with its dubloon value. The slime contains 70 dubloons worth of morphing power, and can be used on multiple Relics with that total value or less - however, the last Relic that is duplicated can put you over the 70 dubloon total, so long as that Relic is worth 70 dublooms or less. This Relic can also copy Relics woth over 70 dubloons, but in that case that Relic would have to be the sole Relic that you copy.

Some examples: A : (20)->(30)->(20) = total 70, done.

B: (20)->(30)->(40) = total 90, over 70, done.

C: (120) done, only possible configuration for duplicating a Relic worth this much.

<<nobr>>
The current total value of relics you have copied is $tempValue dubloons.<br><br>

<<if $tempValue == 0>>
<<if $ownedRelics.length==1>>
	<<set $temp=0>>
<<else>>
	<<for $i = 0; $i < $ownedRelics.length && !$endloop; $i++>>

		<<endif>>
	<</for>>
	<<set $soldRelics.push($ownedRelics[$temp])>>
	<<set $ownedRelics.deleteAt($temp)>>
<<endif>>

Please choose the relic you would like to copy:<br>
<<for $i = 0; $i < $ownedRelics.length; $i++>>
	<<capture $i>>
			<<print $ownedRelics[$i].name>><<print " for ">><<print ($ownedRelics[$i].value)>><<print " dubloons ">><<print "[[Copy|Kin Shifter Use][$ownedRelics.push($ownedRelics[$i]), $tempValue += $ownedRelics[$i].value]]">><br>

		<<endif>>
	<</capture>>
<</for>>

<<else>>
As you touched the final relic to the Kin Shifter, the last of the goo was used up and your relic was copied. The cute eyes faded as the slime transmuted into the new relic you chose. <br><br>

Now that you have become better equipped, you can continue your journey.<br><br>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Use
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/forbiddengrimoire.png"]]
<<nobr>>
<<if $temp1 == 0>>
A grisly-looking ragged book written in an indecipherable language. Words can only be seen on the page when a person reads it alone, and they vanish as that one person reads them. This will take whatever skills the reader possesses and improve them greatly, leaving a blank, non-useful book behind. Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would redduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways. If one person were to read it twice (such as through Kin Shifter), the second use would have no benefit - best to spread it out among multiple companions.<br><br>
It's useless once it's been used once of course, so choose wisely who will get the benefit.<br><br>

Who do you want to give the grimoire to improve their skills?<br><br>

<<for $i = 0; $i < $hiredCompanions.length; $i++>>

		<<print "[[$hiredCompanions[$i].name|Forbidden Grimoire Use][$temp = $i, $temp1 = 1]]">><br>

<<else>>
You have given the eldritch knowledge contained in the book to $hiredCompanions[$temp}.name.<br><br>
<<if $hiredCompanions[$temp].name == "Maru">>
While Maru great appreciates your gift and improves the taste of his cooking, you don't gain any material benefit on your journey from giving it to him.
<<elseif $hiredCompanions[$temp].name == "Lily">>
After reading from the book, Lily's tongue seems just the slightest bit quicker and she sounds more convincing than ever. You now gain 20 extra dubloons when selling Relics with her on the surface.<<set $sellAdd += 10>>
<<elseif $hiredCompanions[$temp].name == "Khemia">>
After reading from the book, Khemia's seems to always spot even more efficient routes than before, as if he were intuitively able to tell the best paths through the Abyss. Travel times in the Abyss are now reduced by 4 days instead of 2 while he is with you.<<set $timeRed += 2>>
<<elseif $hiredCompanions[$temp].name == "Cherry">>
After reading from the book, Cherry seems to somberly ponder what she read for a few minutes, occasionally looking at her own body as if she were truly seeing it for the first time. The duration of status effects with a predetermined length is now reduced by 2 days instead of 1.<<set $statRed += 1>>
<<elseif $hiredCompanions[$temp].name == "Cloud">>
After reading from the book, Cloud lines up his finger with a rock in the distance, mime's a gunshot, then turns to you and smiles. "I've got to test out some of the stuff I saw in there, it's crazy stuff." You now have to spend 4 less bullets for any task instead of 2 less.<<set $bullRed += 10>>
<<elseif $hiredCompanions[$temp].name == "Saeko">>
After reading from the book, Saeko's looks a bit sad as she turns the last page, as if hoping there was more to learn. After that, she is able to use innovative techniques you've never seen before to minimzie your exposure to the miasma whenever possible. You now subtract 10 from all corruption costs in the Abyss, rather than 5.<<set $corrRed += 5>>

:: L2 Gooey end [ending]
You stand on the cupboard directly over the two man, a small camera relic in hand waiting for the perfect moment.
"Are you sure mister Reed won't find out about this ?", " He is very ... unkind to traitors and what you are planning is ... . "He won't find out, the plan is as safe as safe can be, and afterward we'll be richer than he could ever imagine". the two man leave after checking the windows and locking the door and you start your job. You jump down from the cupboard without hurting yourself thanks to your slime-like body and look for the plans on the desk. Once you found them you use your camera to photograph them and crawl back up to the cupboard once again using your slime-like properties. Smiling to yourself you leave through a mousehole. At first, you were devastated by your new body, you tried your best to continue your journey with your small and slimy body but in the end, you had to give up. stranded on the second layer you cursed your fate. You survived the first month by stealing. You ended up getting crushed and squished more times than you can count but always bouncing back once everyone left thanks to your slimy body. After a while, mister Reed approached you with an offer to work as a spy for him. Mister Reed is one of the most dangerous people in the upper layers of the Abyss he has connections reaching all the way up to the surface and some rumors say even down on the fourth layer.
 After a while you finally make it back to your boss.
 "Gerard I finally got them" You say presenting him the camera. After working for him for many years now you are on a first-name basis with him."Oh just what i was expecting i take it you have undeniable proof ?"."Of course who do you think I am, some amateur?", "They were cunning though, it took weeks to find their headquarter".
"Well you did well. As always, I might add. You should take a break before heading out again." He says.  "I would really like to get my hands on whatever they were try to steal in the end".You muse.
"And I need to prepare a fitting punishment for them... Did they really think they could get away with trying to pin the blame on me for whatever they were after, fools..". You just shrug your shoulders and leave. What happens next is none of your business, as long as you get paid you are happy. In the end you started to understand why some people call curses a blessing.


:: Balloon Workshop [noreturn]
[img[setup.ImagePath+$items[19].image]]

You can use the balloon to send requests and relics back to Outset Town. You can send up any Relics you have along with what you want done to them and the people at the workshop can reply and send back any modified Relics you want.

	<<if $ownedRelics[$i].name == "Romer Stones" && $warmCloth == 0 && $coolCloth == 0>>
	<br>You muse over what you can do with the Romer Stones, taking advantage over their ability for limitless small-scale heating or cooling.<br><br>
	You can either buy some winter clothers for 30 dubloons to craft self-warming winter gear, or you could buy some light summer clothing for 25 dubloons to craft some cooling summer clothes.<br>

	<<if $ownedRelics[$i].name == "Brave Vector" && $slingshot == 0>>
		<br>The Brave Vector seems like it should have some application as a weapon, but it turns out that it is exceedingly difficult to use a bent pipe like that as a gun substitute. Luckily, with the help of the resident Relic experts, you can change the form of the Brave Vector to a much more useful one. They seem to reccomend a sort of metal slingshot design, which should be able to function like a gun, but will be able to use anything of approximately the correct size as ammo. <br>
		<br>The raw materials for this are relatively cheap, letting you reshape the Brave Vector for only 10 dubloons.<br>
		[[Reshape the Brave Vector into a powerful slingshot|Balloon Workshop][$slingshot = 1, $dubloon -= 10]]<br>

	<<if $ownedRelics[$i].name == "Joyous Sunder" && $joyousSword == 0>>
		<br>The Joyous Sunder is an incredibly powerful offensive tool, but it is limited by its form as a small knife. Luckily, with the help of the local Relic Engineers, you can reshape this Relic into a true sword that an expert swordsman would feel comfortable using. A weapon like that would be literally unstoppable by any enemy that can be defeated by physical attacks and does not disable the user before they can get close enough to use it. This would be most useful in the hands of someone like Khemia, letting him defeat powerful beasts from the depths of the Abyss without fear of injury himself. The materials to forge a sword from the Joyous Sunder would cost you 20 dubloons.<br>
