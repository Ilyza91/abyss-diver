@@.layerTitle;LAYER 3 - VEINS OF TARTARUS@@

As you reach the end of the second layer and the everpresent rain gradually abates, the terrain of the Abyss slowly begins to change alongside your march downward. The space between the rock formations you've been hiking down begins to shrink, the smaller rock outcroppings meerging into singular masses of land. Before long, the Abyss begins to feel less like a single pt and more like many tunnels burrowing through the earth, twisting and turning into themselves to form a massive, incomprehensible cave network. Whenever you speak, your own voice echoes back to beckon you further down.

The miasma produces no light in this layer, and these dark, twisted caverns are slow to navigate without a light source, such as a torch or flashlight. If you have such a source of light, you may subtract 1 day from all the time costs on this page. Remember that if you're using torches, they will last for exactly one choice in this layer - including ascending or descending layers.

The Abyss has various bioluminescent moss, mushrooms, and so on scattered about, so exploring these caves wihout a source of light isn't so implossible or as much of suicide mission as exploring caves on the surface without a light source would be - though doing so would still be quite difficult down here.

Your steps echo as you walk through the seemingly endless, dimly-lit caves of the third layer. Occasionally a small sound comes from some direction, but you can't tell which. The light from the glowing fungus and plants on the walls seems off to you. As helpful as it is, it leaves you with a yearning to see the sun above the surface again soon.

<br><br>As you walk through the caverns of the third layer, you come across what initally seems to be a clear pond, a potential source of clean water! But upon further inspection, you realize that rather than water, it is a slime that is a very transluscent blue color. Luckily you noticed it in time and didn't consume any, but it serves as a reminder that strange things lurk in these tunnels. You notice a small crab suspended in the slime, apparently one that didn't recognize the difference between the slime and water until it was too late. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
<br><br>You notice a scurrying out of the corner of your eye on one of the walls. Preparing yourself for the worst, you ready yourself for a fight against whatever you noticed, but instead you spot a few glowing, scurrying crabs, each about 5 centimeters across, using their claws to clip some fungus and consume it. The color of the crabs seems almost like the color of the light given off by the fungus. Perhaps this is a part of the ecosystem here?<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 3>>
<br><br>A few glowing crabs skitter in front of you and quickly dart into a hole in the wall. You notice what they're running from a moment after them as a small bundle of tentacles slides across the ground, reaching a long arm forward to grab one of the crabs. Once it has a hold of the crab, it seems to extend a number of tiny feeler tentacles that gently caress the crab over its entire body and over time work themselves into all of the crab's orifices. After a minute of infiltration, the tentacle blob turns around to where it came, crab in tow, and seems to be more leasuirely in its pace. Something inside you feels some empathy for that crab, given your own situation in the Abyss.<br><br>

Ascending to the previous layer will take 6 days, and cost 25 corruption.

In case you were wondering, there is one straight-shot passage through this layer between layers two and four that baloons funnel into on their way up through the Abyss. However, the sides of the tunnel are coated in a concentrated form of miasma that make it essentially impossible to get through without using a balloon or another way of flying.

[[Continue your ascent|Layer3 Ascend2]]
[[Turn back and continue your business on the third layer|Layer3 Hub]]


:: Layer3 Exit1 [layer3]
Descending further still will take 6 days. The tunnels are so twisted and involve so much turning around and climbing up and down that the trip through the layer is about the same length, whether you're ascending or descending.

Easily-accessible foraged food isn't guaranteed from here on. Taking a gun with plenty of ammunition is advised if you wish to continue living off the land.

In the deeper parts of the layer, a cold breeze occasionally blows through the caverns, hinting at something frigid deeper below.

It felt warm and vaguely soothing, as if it were purging you of a part of the miasma's corrupting effects.

You have gained $temp corruption points!

As you pick up the dubloons from the scales, you notice that the luster of the scales seems to have faded. Perhaps they only had tht final use left in them or perhaps they will only serve to help you one time. Regardless, you won't be using them again on this journey.

:: Take on Gooey [layer3]
<<set $playerCurses.push($curse37)>><<set $corruption += $curse37.corr>>

A sudden wave of nausea washes over your entire body, as if your stomach was turning inside out inside of you. You heave to vomit, but nothing comes out, instead the feeling of nausea increases.

You dry heave again, and again, but nothing comes out and the sensation only becomes more and more intense. You squeeze your fists tightly in frustration, but strangely your fingers seem to almost sink into the flesh of you palm.

The feeling of nausea wanes and you finally have a chance to examine your body for any changes. At first glance, you don't seem any different, but that only lasts for one glance, as your whole body seems more fluid, more gooey.

A few quick experiments indicate that your whole body is now made of some goo-like substance that is malleable, but always returns to your base shape if deformed. Luckily you still seem to be about as strong as you were before, but the sensation of moving is always a little different. Maybe it's because you don't have the same sort of muscles or skin or some other part of your body, but everything is just a little bit different.

Despite the drastic change, you don't have much time to ponder it as you do need to get moving once again eventually. It will certainly be a big change in your life to be a being of slime and goo rather than flesh and bone for the rest of your life.

After spending $tempTime days searching for a river, you manage to eventually find one. In an effort to replenish the water it cost you to get here, you fill all your flasks, taking in the cool, fresh water.

As predicted, the water is pure and you can drink it without side effects!

The float through this layer is pretty uneventful, as the tunnel is dark around your balloon, not giving you much to see aside from an occasional patch of bioluminescent mushrooms growing on the walls. Luckily you seem to be able to move through the complex of tunnels relatively smoothly in your balloon.

:: Layer3 Preview [image layer3 noreturn]
As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Layer Intros/l3intro.png']]

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 3 - VEINS OF TARTARUS@@

You see yourself standing in the middle of a dark, dry cavern, with a few spots of what seems to be glowing fungus on the side of the cave to give you a chance to see the shape of the stone around you. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 4-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 4-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 4-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 4-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the relic is cracked and broken.
